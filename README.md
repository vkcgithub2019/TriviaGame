In this assignment, I have to create a trivia game/Basic Quiz in a timed form. There will be 10 trivia questions and the player will have to answer them in a set time. This is a multiple choice quiz and each question will have 30 seconds for the player to select the correct answer from a list of 4 answers. Only one answer can be selected. There will be a timer and will start as soon as the player starts the game. The game will be over when the time is out and there will be an output to show the number of questions that the player answer correctly and incorrectly. The theme for this game is the popular movie series, Kung Fu Panda.
